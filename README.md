# Brass Warmup ðŸŽº
**Warm up frictionless-ly!**

A simple Python warm-up script

## How It Works
- Breathing/mouthpiece exercises

    Customizable length of seconds to breathe-in and breathe-out (and even hold) to get your lungs ready for playing.
- Long tone

    Just a simple counter to 100 or to whatever number you wish! Perfect to play a note for that amount of time to warm up.
- Random exercise

    A simple random number generator to choose which exercise in your exercise book you will play today.
- Random piece from a local path

    A randomiser that chooses which pieces in a directory you will practice for 40 hours. Bonus: you can open the files directly in VSCode if you want, using Ctrl+Click!
- Random piece from a YouTube playlist
    
    Another randomiser that chooses which pieces in a YouTube playlist you will practice for 40 hours. Just plug in the YouTube playlist URL and you will get a title and a clickable link.
